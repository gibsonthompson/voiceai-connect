      <p>
        <strong>Restaurants receive more phone calls per day than almost any other small business — 
        and miss more of them too.</strong> During lunch and dinner rush, no one has time to answer 
        the phone. Callers asking about hours, reservations, takeout menus, dietary options, and 
        party bookings get voicemail or an endless ring. Each unanswered call is a lost reservation, 
        a lost catering inquiry, or a frustrated regular who goes elsewhere. AI receptionists solve 
        this instantly — and restaurants are one of the fastest-growing niches for AI agency owners.
      </p>

      <h2 id="why-restaurants">Why Restaurants Are a Great Niche</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Extremely high call volume.</strong> A typical restaurant receives 30–80+ calls per 
        day. During service hours (11 AM–2 PM and 5 PM–9 PM), the kitchen is slamming, the host 
        stand is packed, and the phone rings constantly. Staff can't answer every call — they're 
        seating guests, running food, and handling the chaos of a live restaurant.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Most calls are repetitive.</strong> "What time do you close?" "Do you take 
        reservations?" "Are you open on Monday?" "Do you have gluten-free options?" "Can I place 
        a takeout order?" These questions get asked 50+ times per week and have the same answer 
        every time. AI handles repetitive questions better than humans — it never gets tired of 
        answering "what are your hours?" for the hundredth time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>There are restaurants everywhere.</strong> Every city has hundreds or thousands of 
        restaurants. The prospect list builds itself. And unlike plumbing companies (where you might 
        exhaust your local market at 200 businesses), restaurants give you an almost unlimited pool.
      </p>

      <h2 id="the-problem">The Phone Problem in Restaurants</h2>

      <p>
        Restaurants face a unique version of the missed-call problem: they're busiest when calls 
        are most frequent. The dinner rush from 6–8 PM is when people call to make reservations, 
        check wait times, ask about the menu, or place takeout orders. It's also when the entire 
        staff is occupied with in-house guests.
      </p>

      <p>
        The host or server who answers the phone is being pulled away from guests who are already 
        there. They rush through the call, give incomplete information, or put the caller on hold 
        for 3 minutes while they deal with a table. Neither the caller nor the in-house guest gets 
        great service.
      </p>

      <p>
        The AI receptionist eliminates this entirely. Every call gets answered instantly — whether 
        it's 6:30 PM on a Saturday (peak rush) or 10 AM on a Tuesday (before the restaurant opens). 
        Staff focus on guests in the building. The AI handles the phone.
      </p>

      <h2 id="what-ai-handles">What the AI Actually Handles</h2>

      <ComparisonTable
        headers={['Call Type', 'Frequency', 'How AI Handles It']}
        rows={[
          ['Hours & location', '15–20/day', 'Instant answer from knowledge base'],
          ['Reservation requests', '5–15/day', 'Captures party size, date, time, name, phone — texts to host'],
          ['Menu questions', '5–10/day', 'Answers from uploaded menu (dietary, specials, pricing)'],
          ['Takeout / delivery', '5–15/day', 'Captures order details or directs to online ordering'],
          ['Private events / catering', '2–5/week', 'Captures event details, forwards to manager'],
          ['Wait time inquiries', '5–10/day', 'Provides estimated wait or offers callback'],
        ]}
      />

      <p>
        The highest-value call type is private events and catering inquiries. A single catering 
        booking can be worth $2,000–$10,000. These calls often come in during off-hours when no 
        one's at the restaurant — the AI captures every detail and forwards it to the owner, 
        ensuring no big-ticket inquiry slips through.
      </p>

      <h2 id="finding-prospects">Finding Restaurant Prospects</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Google Maps:</strong> Search "restaurants [your city]" — you'll get thousands of 
        results. Focus on independent restaurants and small groups (1–5 locations), not chains 
        (McDonald's, Olive Garden) which have corporate systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The timing test:</strong> Call restaurants at 6:30 PM on a Friday or Saturday. 
        You'll get one of three outcomes: no answer (voicemail or endless ring), a rushed answer 
        ("Can you hold?"), or a long hold. All three are pain points you can solve.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Best approach time:</strong> Call restaurant owners between 2–4 PM (after lunch, 
        before dinner service). This is when managers handle admin tasks and are most receptive 
        to business conversations.
      </p>

      <Callout type="tip">
        Target restaurants that DON'T use OpenTable, Resy, or other reservation platforms. These 
        restaurants rely entirely on phone calls for reservations — meaning your AI has the 
        highest impact. You can identify them by checking if their Google listing has a "Reserve" 
        button or by calling and seeing if they take phone reservations.
      </Callout>

      <h2 id="the-pitch">The Pitch (Restaurant-Specific)</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>The opening:</strong> "Hey, is the manager or owner available? [If yes:] Hi, this 
        is [Your Name]. Quick question — I called your restaurant last Friday at 7 PM and the 
        phone rang 10 times. How many calls like that do you think you miss during dinner rush?"
      </p>

      <p>
        [They'll acknowledge it's a problem — every restaurant owner knows.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The pitch:</strong> "I set up AI phone answering for restaurants. It answers every 
        call your staff can't get to — handles hours questions, takes reservation requests, answers 
        menu questions, and captures catering inquiries. Your staff focuses on guests in the 
        building, the AI handles the phone. Want to hear what it sounds like?"
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Key angle:</strong> Frame it as freeing staff from the phone, not replacing them. 
        "Your host shouldn't have to choose between the guest at the door and the phone ringing. 
        The AI handles the phone so they can focus on the people in front of them."
      </p>

      <h2 id="objections">Restaurant Objections</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>"Our guests want the personal touch — not a robot."</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Your guests in the restaurant absolutely want personal service — and your staff should 
        focus 100% on them. But the caller asking 'what time do you close?' for the 30th time 
        today? They just want the answer fast. The AI gives it to them instantly while your team 
        stays focused on the dining room."
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>"We already have a host who answers the phone."</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        "And during rush, they're seating a party of 6, scanning the waitlist, and handing menus 
        to a walk-in — and the phone's ringing. The AI catches every call they can't get to. 
        Think of it as their backup, not their replacement."
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>"We use OpenTable / Resy for reservations."</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        "That covers guests who book online. But what about the caller who wants to know if you 
        can accommodate a party of 12 next Saturday? Or the corporate event planner asking about 
        your private dining room? Those calls still come by phone, and they're your highest-value 
        inquiries. The AI captures them when you can't."
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>"We can't afford it — margins are thin."</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        "I get it — restaurant margins are tight. That's exactly why every call matters. If the AI 
        captures one catering inquiry per month that would've gone to voicemail — even a $1,500 
        event — it's paid for itself ten times over. And it's a fraction of the cost of adding 
        another staff member to answer phones."
      </p>

      <h2 id="pricing">What to Charge Restaurants</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Sweet spot: $99–$149/month.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Restaurants are more price-sensitive than law firms or dental offices. Keep pricing 
        accessible — $99/month is an easy "yes" for most restaurant owners. At $149/month, offer 
        a premium tier with menu integration, event inquiry capture, and weekly call reports.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Volume strategy:</strong> Because there are so many restaurants in any city, you can 
        compensate for lower per-client pricing with higher volume. Twenty restaurant clients at 
        $99/month = $1,980/month recurring. With platform costs of $30–$50/client, your margin is 
        still 50–70%.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Multi-location discount:</strong> Restaurant groups with 2–5 locations are premium 
        clients. Offer a per-location rate ($79–$99/location) that's slightly discounted but 
        guaranteed across all locations. A 4-location group at $89/location = $356/month from 
        one client.

      <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Can AI actually take reservations?</h3>
      <p>
        The AI captures reservation requests — party size, date, time, name, phone number, and 
        special requests — and texts the details to the host stand or manager instantly. For 
        restaurants without a booking system, the AI can integrate with Google Calendar or similar 
        tools to check availability. It's not a full reservation management system like OpenTable, 
        but it captures 100% of phone reservation requests that would otherwise go to voicemail.
      </p>

      <h3>What about taking food orders by phone?</h3>
      <p>
        AI can capture basic order details and forward them to the kitchen, or direct callers to 
        an online ordering link. For restaurants with complex menus and heavy customization, 
        directing to online ordering is usually more reliable. For simpler menus (pizza, Chinese 
        takeout), AI can capture the full order including modifications.
      </p>

      <h3>Are restaurants worth the lower pricing?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes — because of volume. There are 10–50x more restaurants than law firms or dental offices 
        in most cities. Lower pricing per client is offset by a much larger addressable market and 
        easier sales conversations (restaurant owners deal with the phone problem daily and 
        recognize it instantly). Many top agency owners have 30–50 restaurant clients.
