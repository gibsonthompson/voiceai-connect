      <p>
        <strong>VoiceAI Connect and Trillet are both white-label AI receptionist platforms built for 
        agencies, but they take fundamentally different approaches.</strong> VoiceAI Connect focuses on 
        simplicity — fast setup, clean branding, and a streamlined experience designed for agency owners 
        who want to start selling quickly without technical complexity. Trillet positions itself as a 
        "native platform" with deeper technical features like multi-agent orchestration and outbound 
        calling campaigns. The right choice depends on whether you prioritize speed-to-revenue and 
        simplicity (VoiceAI Connect) or advanced technical capabilities (Trillet).

      />

      <h2 id="pricing">Pricing Breakdown</h2>

      <p>
        Both platforms start at $99/month, but the pricing models differ in important ways that affect 
        your margins as an agency.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>VoiceAI Connect</strong> uses a flat-rate model where voice minutes are included in your 
        plan. This makes your cost per client predictable — you know exactly what you'll pay regardless 
        of how many calls your clients receive. For agencies, predictable costs mean predictable margins. 
        You can confidently quote clients $149/month knowing your per-client cost is fixed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Trillet</strong> charges a platform fee ($99–$299/month) plus per-minute voice charges 
        at $0.09/minute. This means your costs scale with usage. A client receiving 500 minutes of 
        calls per month adds $45 in per-minute charges on top of your platform fee. For low-volume 
        clients this can be cheaper, but for busy businesses (medical offices, law firms) the per-minute 
        charges can erode margins quickly.
      </p>

      <Callout type="tip">
        When comparing pricing, calculate your total cost at realistic call volumes. A plumber 
        receiving 200 calls/month averaging 2 minutes each (400 minutes) would cost $36/month in 
        per-minute fees on Trillet — on top of the platform fee. With VoiceAI Connect, that usage 
        is included in the flat rate.
      </Callout>

      <h2 id="white-label">White-Label Quality</h2>

      <p>
        Both platforms offer white-labeling, but the depth and quality differ.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>VoiceAI Connect</strong> provides complete white-labeling from the Professional plan 
        up — custom domain, your branding on all client-facing pages, a branded marketing website 
        your clients see when they visit your agency's site, and branded client dashboards. The 
        setup is straightforward: upload your logo, pick your colors, connect your domain, and you're 
        live. Your clients never see VoiceAI Connect's branding anywhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Trillet</strong> offers white-labeling on the Agency plan ($299/month), including custom 
        domain, branded dashboards, and client portals. Their white-label implementation is solid, 
        though some agencies have noted that certain Trillet branding elements can occasionally surface 
        in email notifications or edge cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Key difference:</strong> VoiceAI Connect includes a fully-designed marketing website 
        template that agencies can customize and use as their public-facing site — complete with 
        pricing pages, feature sections, and signup flows. This saves agencies the cost and time 
        of building their own website from scratch.
      </p>

      <h2 id="onboarding">Client Onboarding Experience</h2>

      <p>
        How quickly you can get a new client live directly impacts your efficiency and client satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>VoiceAI Connect</strong> offers pre-built industry templates — when you add a new client, 
        you select their industry (plumbing, dental, legal, HVAC, etc.) and the AI is automatically 
        configured with industry-appropriate greetings, common questions, call flows, and terminology. 
        A typical client setup takes under 5 minutes. The client gets a phone number, a configured AI 
        receptionist, and dashboard access immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Trillet</strong> uses website scraping to bootstrap AI knowledge — you paste the client's 
        website URL and the platform extracts business information automatically. This is a clever 
        approach, but it requires the client to have a well-structured website with accurate information. 
        For small businesses with minimal web presence, you'll need to manually configure more details. 
        Typical setup is 10–15 minutes.
      </p>

      <h2 id="ai-quality">AI Voice Quality & Features</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>VoiceAI Connect</strong> uses VAPI for voice AI processing, which provides access to 
        multiple voice providers and LLM models. You can select different voice personas, adjust 
        conversation styles, and fine-tune the AI's behavior per client. The AI handles inbound calls, 
        captures caller information, sends SMS summaries, and integrates with calendars for appointment 
        booking.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Trillet</strong> has built a native voice AI stack, meaning they control the entire 
        pipeline from speech recognition to response generation. They claim this provides lower latency 
        and more predictable costs compared to "wrapper" platforms that rely on third-party providers. 
        Trillet also offers outbound calling campaigns and multi-agent orchestration (their "Crews" 
        feature), which are advanced features VoiceAI Connect doesn't currently offer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Where Trillet wins:</strong> Outbound calling and multi-agent workflows. If your agency 
        plans to offer outbound lead qualification or complex multi-step call sequences, Trillet has 
        a clear advantage.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Where VoiceAI Connect wins:</strong> Simplicity and speed. For agencies focused on 
        the core use case (AI receptionist answering inbound calls for local businesses), VoiceAI 
        Connect delivers a cleaner, faster experience with less configuration overhead.
      </p>

      <h2 id="agency-tools">Agency Management Tools</h2>

      <p>
        Both platforms provide agency dashboards for managing multiple clients, but the tooling 
        differs in philosophy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>VoiceAI Connect</strong> gives you a centralized dashboard where you can see all 
        clients at a glance — call volumes, active status, recent calls, and billing. Adding new 
        clients is a guided flow with industry templates. The platform emphasizes reducing the 
        time you spend on administration so you can focus on sales.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Trillet</strong> provides more granular control — detailed analytics, call outcome 
        tracking, and workflow builders. They also offer a referral program where you can earn 40% 
        recurring commissions for referring other agencies to the platform. For agencies that want 
        deep visibility into call data and client performance metrics, Trillet provides more robust 
        analytics.
      </p>

      <h2 id="integrations">Integrations</h2>

      <ComparisonTable
        headers={['Integration', 'VoiceAI Connect', 'Trillet']}
        rows={[
          ['Google Calendar', '✅', '✅'],
          ['GoHighLevel', '✅ Native', '✅'],
          ['Stripe Billing', '✅ Built-in', '✅'],
          ['HubSpot CRM', 'Via webhook', '✅ Native'],
          ['Meta/Facebook Leads', '❌', '✅ Native'],
          ['Zapier', '✅', '✅'],
          ['SMS Follow-Up', '✅', '✅'],
          ['Custom Webhooks', '✅', '✅'],
        ]}
      />

      <p>
        Trillet has an edge in native CRM integrations, particularly with HubSpot and Meta/Facebook 
        lead ads. VoiceAI Connect's GoHighLevel integration is a standout for agencies already in 
        the GHL ecosystem. Both platforms support webhooks and Zapier for custom workflows.
      </p>

      <h2 id="support">Support & Resources</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>VoiceAI Connect</strong> provides direct support via email and chat, onboarding 
        assistance for new agencies, and documentation. The platform is designed to be self-service 
        for most tasks — the simplicity of the interface reduces the need for support.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Trillet</strong> includes a Skool community with weekly Q&A sessions on their Agency 
        plan, along with sales playbooks, contract templates, and training materials. They've invested 
        heavily in agency enablement resources, which can be valuable for newer agency owners who want 
        guidance on sales and operations.
      </p>

      <h2 id="who-should-choose">Who Should Choose Which?</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Choose VoiceAI Connect if:</strong> you want the fastest path from signup to selling, 
        you value simple flat-rate pricing with predictable margins, you primarily serve local service 
        businesses with inbound call needs, you want a fully branded marketing website out of the box, 
        or you're already in the GoHighLevel ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Choose Trillet if:</strong> you need outbound calling capabilities for lead qualification, 
        you want multi-agent orchestration for complex workflows, you serve healthcare clients requiring 
        HIPAA compliance, you want a community of other agency owners for networking and support, or 
        you prefer per-minute pricing because your clients have low call volumes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Bottom line:</strong> VoiceAI Connect is the better choice for agencies that want to 
        start selling fast with minimal complexity. Trillet is the better choice for agencies that need 
        advanced features and don't mind a steeper learning curve. Both are legitimate platforms — the 
        right choice depends on your business model and target market.

      <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Can I switch from Trillet to VoiceAI Connect (or vice versa)?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Both platforms allow you to export client information and set up new phone numbers. The 
        main migration task is reconfiguring your clients' AI assistants on the new platform — typically 
        1–2 hours total for a portfolio of 10–20 clients. Phone number porting may or may not be 
        available depending on the carrier.
      </p>

      <h3>Which platform has better AI voice quality?</h3>
      <p>
        Both platforms deliver natural-sounding AI voices suitable for professional business calls. 
        Trillet controls its own voice stack; VoiceAI Connect leverages VAPI's multi-provider approach. 
        In practice, callers on both platforms report similar experiences. The best way to judge is to 
        call each platform's demo number yourself.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I need outbound calling for an AI receptionist agency?</h3>
      <p>
        For most agencies starting out — no. The core value proposition is answering inbound calls 
        that businesses are currently missing. Outbound calling is an advanced feature that becomes 
        valuable once you've established a client base and want to offer additional services like 
        lead follow-up or appointment reminders. Start with inbound, add outbound later if needed.
      </p>

      <h3>Which platform is better for complete beginners?</h3>
      <p>
        VoiceAI Connect has a gentler learning curve thanks to its industry templates and streamlined 
        setup process. Trillet offers more features but requires more configuration time. If you've 
        never run an agency before, VoiceAI Connect's simplicity will get you to your first client 
        faster. If you have technical comfort and want more control, Trillet's depth may appeal to you.
