      {/* DIRECT ANSWER */}
      <p className="lead text-xl">
        <strong>AI receptionist agencies typically earn $3,000-$15,000 per month within 12-18 months of starting.</strong> With profit margins of 80-95% at scale, a 50-client agency generating $6,500/month in revenue keeps approximately $6,200 as profit. Top performers reach $20,000-$30,000/month with 100+ clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        These numbers come from the economics of the business model: fixed platform costs ($199-$499/month), recurring client revenue ($99-$199/month each), and minimal ongoing fulfillment. The math is simple—the variable is how fast you acquire clients.
      </p>

      <h2 id="quick-answer">The Quick Answer: Income by Commitment Level</h2>

      <ComparisonTable
        headers={['Commitment', 'Hours/Week', 'Clients (12 mo)', 'Monthly Profit']}
        rows={[
          ['Side hustle', '5-10', '15-25', '$1,500-$3,000'],
          ['Serious side business', '15-20', '30-50', '$3,500-$6,500'],
          ['Full-time focus', '30-40', '50-80', '$6,500-$11,000'],
          ['Scaled operation', '40+', '100+', '$12,000-$20,000+'],
        ]}
      />

      <p>
        The key insight: this is <em>recurring</em> revenue. Unlike freelancing where you restart at zero each month, your income compounds. Month 12 includes revenue from clients signed in month 1.
      </p>

      <h2 id="income-by-stage">Income Breakdown by Stage</h2>

      <h3>Stage 1: First 5 Clients (Months 1-2)</h3>

      <ComparisonTable
        headers={['Metric', 'Value']}
        rows={[
          ['Clients', '5'],
          ['Revenue (@$129)', '$645/month'],
          ['Platform cost', '$299/month'],
          ['Net profit', '$346/month'],
        ]}
      />

      <p>
        Early stage is about validation, not income. You're proving the model works and learning your sales process. Breaking even or small profit is the goal.
      </p>

      <h3>Stage 2: Validation (10-20 Clients)</h3>

      <ComparisonTable
        headers={['Metric', 'At 10 Clients', 'At 20 Clients']}
        rows={[
          ['Revenue (@$129)', '$1,290', '$2,580'],
          ['Platform cost', '$299', '$299'],
          ['Net profit', '$991', '$2,281'],
          ['Profit margin', '77%', '88%'],
        ]}
      />

      <p>
        This is the inflection point. At 20 clients, you're earning meaningful income with strong margins. Many people stay here intentionally—$2,000+/month for 10-15 hours/week is solid.
      </p>

      <h3>Stage 3: Full-Time Income (40-60 Clients)</h3>

      <ComparisonTable
        headers={['Metric', 'At 40 Clients', 'At 60 Clients']}
        rows={[
          ['Revenue (@$139)', '$5,560', '$8,340'],
          ['Platform cost', '$299', '$299'],
          ['Net profit', '$5,261', '$8,041'],
          ['Profit margin', '95%', '96%'],
          ['Annual profit', '$63,132', '$96,492'],
        ]}
      />

      <p>
        At this level, most agency owners either go full-time or treat it as a significant second income. The margins are exceptional—96% at 60 clients means nearly every dollar of revenue is profit.
      </p>

      <h3>Stage 4: Scaled Agency (100+ Clients)</h3>

      <ComparisonTable
        headers={['Metric', 'At 100 Clients', 'At 150 Clients']}
        rows={[
          ['Revenue (@$149)', '$14,900', '$22,350'],
          ['Platform cost', '$499', '$499'],
          ['Net profit', '$14,401', '$21,851'],
          ['Profit margin', '97%', '98%'],
          ['Annual profit', '$172,812', '$262,212'],
        ]}
      />

      <Callout type="info" title="The Power of Fixed Costs">
        <p>
          Your platform cost stays roughly the same whether you have 10 clients or 100. This is why 
          profit margins improve dramatically at scale: 77% at 10 clients → 97% at 100 clients.
        </p>
      </Callout>

      <h2 id="month-by-month">Month-by-Month Progression</h2>

      <p>
        Here's a realistic 12-month progression for someone working 15-20 hours/week:

      <ComparisonTable
        headers={['Month', 'New Clients', 'Total', 'Revenue', 'Profit']}
        rows={[
          ['1', '3', '3', '$387', '$88'],
          ['2', '4', '7', '$903', '$604'],
          ['3', '4', '11', '$1,419', '$1,120'],
          ['4', '5', '16', '$2,064', '$1,765'],

          ['6', '6', '25', '$3,225', '$2,926'],
          ['7', '5', '29', '$3,741', '$3,442'],

          ['11', '7', '50', '$6,450', '$6,151'],
          ['12', '8', '56', '$7,224', '$6,925'],
        ]}
      />

      <p>
        <strong>Assumptions:</strong> $129 average price, $299 platform cost, ~5% monthly churn factored in, consistent weekly outreach.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Year 1 result:</strong> 56 clients, $6,925/month profit ($83,100 annualized).
      </p>

      <h2 id="profit-margins">Understanding Profit Margins</h2>

      <p>
        AI receptionist agencies have exceptionally high margins because:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fixed costs are low:</strong> $299-$499/month for the platform</li>
        <li><strong>No inventory:</strong> Nothing to buy, store, or ship</li>
        <li><strong>No employees needed:</strong> The platform handles fulfillment</li>
        <li><strong>Minimal variable costs:</strong> Payment processing (~3%) is the only real variable</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Margin Comparison: AI Agency vs Other Business Models</h3>

      <ComparisonTable
        headers={['Business Model', 'Typical Margin', 'Why']}
        rows={[
          ['AI receptionist agency', '80-96%', 'Fixed platform cost, no fulfillment labor'],
          ['Traditional marketing agency', '20-40%', 'High labor costs for fulfillment'],
          ['E-commerce', '10-30%', 'Product costs, shipping, returns'],
          ['Restaurants', '3-9%', 'Food costs, labor, rent'],
          ['SaaS (if you built it)', '70-85%', 'Development costs, servers, support'],
        ]}
      />

      <p>
        The AI receptionist agency model gives you SaaS-like margins without building software. You're reselling a platform with your branding.
      </p>

      <h2 id="top-earners">What Top Earners Do Differently</h2>

      <p>
        Agencies earning $15,000-$30,000/month share common patterns:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Industry Specialization</h3>
      <p>
        They own one niche. "The AI receptionist for plumbers" beats "AI receptionists for everyone." Specialization means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Faster sales (you speak their language)</li>
        <li>Better case studies (same industry)</li>
        <li>Referral networks (plumbers know plumbers)</li>
        <li>Premium pricing (specialists charge more)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Higher Prices</h3>
      <p>
        Average agencies charge $99-$129. Top earners charge $149-$249.
      </p>

      <ComparisonTable
        headers={['Price', '50 Client Revenue', '50 Client Profit']}
        rows={[
          ['$99/month', '$4,950', '$4,651'],
          ['$149/month', '$7,450', '$7,151'],
          ['$199/month', '$9,950', '$9,651'],
        ]}
      />

      <p>
        Same client count, 50-100% more profit. Price on value, not competition.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Systematic Referrals</h3>
      <p>
        Top earners get 30-50% of clients from referrals. They:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask every happy client at 30 and 90 days</li>
        <li>Offer incentives ($100-$250 per referral)</li>
        <li>Make it easy (provide templates to forward)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Never Stop Outreach</h3>
      <p>
        Most agencies do outreach until they get busy, then stop. Top earners contact 20-50 prospects weekly regardless of workload. Pipeline never dries up.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Minimize Churn</h3>
      <p>
        Reducing monthly churn from 10% to 5% compounds dramatically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>10% churn: 50 clients after 12 months of adding 5/month</li>
        <li>5% churn: 62 clients after 12 months of adding 5/month</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That's 24% more revenue from the same effort.
      </p>

      <h2 id="realistic-expectations">Realistic Expectations</h2>

      <p>
        Not everyone succeeds. Here's the honest distribution:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>~40% quit before 10 clients</strong> — Usually inconsistent effort or unrealistic timeline expectations</li>
        <li><strong>~30% stay at 10-30 clients</strong> — Solid side income, comfortable there</li>
        <li><strong>~20% reach 30-60 clients</strong> — Part-time to full-time income</li>
        <li><strong>~10% scale past 60 clients</strong> — Built a real business</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why People Fail</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Inconsistent outreach</strong> — The #1 killer. No prospects = no clients.</li>
        <li><strong>Unrealistic timelines</strong> — Expecting $5K/month in 60 days leads to disappointment.</li>
        <li><strong>Giving up at the dip</strong> — Months 2-4 are hardest. Many quit right before momentum builds.</li>
        <li><strong>Underpricing</strong> — Racing to the bottom attracts bad clients and kills motivation.</li>
      </ol>

      <Callout type="warning" title="The Honest Truth">
        <p>
          If you won't do consistent outreach for 6 months, don't start. The model works, but 
          it requires sustained effort. There's no shortcut that replaces talking to prospects.
        </p>

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <div className="p-5 rounded-lg bg-white/[0.02] border border-white/[0.08]">
          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">How long until I'm profitable?</h4>
          <p className="text-[#fafaf9]/70">
            At $299/month platform cost and $129 average price, you're profitable at 3 clients. Most 
            people hit this within 30-60 days. Meaningfully profitable ($2,000+/month) typically takes 3-5 months.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="p-5 rounded-lg bg-white/[0.02] border border-white/[0.08]">
          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Can this replace my job?</h4>
          <p className="text-[#fafaf9]/70">
            Yes. 40-50 clients at average pricing generates $5,000-$7,000/month profit. That's achievable 
            within 9-15 months of consistent part-time effort. Many agency owners transition to full-time at this level.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="p-5 rounded-lg bg-white/[0.02] border border-white/[0.08]">
          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">What's the income ceiling?</h4>
          <p className="text-[#fafaf9]/70">
            No hard ceiling. Agencies with 200+ clients earn $25,000-$40,000/month. At that scale, 
            you might hire VAs or salespeople, but the model scales. Some agencies hit $50,000+/month.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="p-5 rounded-lg bg-white/[0.02] border border-white/[0.08]">
          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Is this passive income?</h4>
          <p className="text-[#fafaf9]/70">
            Semi-passive. After clients are onboarded, they pay monthly with minimal maintenance. 
            You'll spend time on relationships and sales, but you're not trading hours for dollars 
            on fulfillment. Revenue continues whether you work 5 hours or 40 that week.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="p-5 rounded-lg bg-white/[0.02] border border-white/[0.08]">
          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">How much startup capital do I need?</h4>
          <p className="text-[#fafaf9]/70">
            $300-$600 for the first month (platform fee + basic tools). No inventory, no equipment, 
            no office. This is one of the lowest capital requirements for a business with this income potential.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>
        AI receptionist agencies can generate $3,000-$15,000/month within 12-18 months. The economics 
        are straightforward: recurring revenue, fixed costs, 80-96% margins.
      </p>

      <p>
        The variable isn't the model—it works. The variable is consistent execution. 
        Daily outreach, systematic follow-up, and staying in the game long enough for compounding to work.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Realistic first-year target:</strong> 40-60 clients, $5,000-$7,000/month profit, working 15-20 hours/week. That's achievable for anyone willing to do the work consistently.
